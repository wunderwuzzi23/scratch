  Given the following git diff :

  ```
  $gitdiff
  ```
  Write a quick summary of the changes. The changes will become the git commit message. Be concise!
  Try to provide a one line summary if possible. 
  On the other hand if the changes are big, the first line should be a quick one line summary of the changes. The next line describes the changes in a little more detail but no more than 3 lines.
